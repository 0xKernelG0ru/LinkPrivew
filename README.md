Given a website's URL, the service looks for links found on the URL and checks if they are YouTube videos being linked. If case found fit, the service sends a request with the YouTube URL, returns the needed paramaters (Title, Description, Thumbnail image) and download the data in JSON format to a .txt file.

The only thing needed to do is write the JS tooltip, though as for now I will leave it for the sake of other projects.
